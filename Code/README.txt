When you open up The Environment Scholar Bitbucket repo, first navigate to the "dev" branch.
Inside the dev branch you will see the folders nvos-scholar and user_database_server.
The nvos-scholar folder contains all the source code for the Angular front end.
The user_database_server folder contains all the code for the server and the database.

To get to the source code you will be working with for the front end, first navigate to the nvos-scholar folder. Inside you will see a folder named "src". Navigate to that folder. Inside the "src" folder, navigate to the "app" folder.
The "app" folder contains all the component.ts, .html, and .css files.
The ontology page was not created using Angular. It was created on a basic html page which is found in the src folder. 

Inside the user_database_server folder, the 3 main folders you will be working with if you need to add/change anything in the database are the controllers, models, and routes folders. The config folder will probably stay the same, and server.js file will also probably not need anything changes/additions. The server.js file is the main file in the user_database_server folder.
